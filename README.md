Diabetes Detection App
This project is a machine learning-based app designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using key health metrics. The app leverages advanced algorithms and a user-friendly interface to assist in early diagnosis and prevention.

Features
Input Metrics: Accepts health parameters like glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, and more.
Accurate Predictions: Powered by trained ML models for reliable results.
Interactive UI: Easy-to-use interface for both medical professionals and patients.
Scalable: Ready for integration with larger health systems or personal health trackers.
Data Privacy: Ensures user data is handled securely and privately.
Tech Stack
Backend: Python with Flask/Django (or your choice)
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn/TensorFlow/PyTorch models trained on public datasets like PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset.
Frontend: ReactJS/HTML-CSS-JS for a smooth user experience.
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL for storing user input and results.
How It Works
Users input their health parameters into the app.
The app processes the data through a pre-trained machine learning model.
The result indicates the probability of diabetes and provides suggestions for follow-up actions.
